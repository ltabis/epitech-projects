To include a monster to the game :

Monster_name {
	[[stat] [value]]
	stats ...
} texture

if there is a missing stat, it will be set on 1 by default.
if a stat isn't know, it will be passed.

the monster file must be a .mstr file.
monster files must be in the "monster" folder.

the texture file must be a .png file and muste be 100*100.

here are all the stats :

[
	current_hp		// current life points
	current_sp		// current shield points
	current_st		// current stamina
	max_hp			// maximum life points
	max_sp			// maximum shiled points
	max_st			// maximum stamina
	att			// attack points
	def			// defense points
	spd			// speed
]

all the stats are needed ! (order doesn't matter)

## EXEMPLE ##

my_monster {
	current_hp 50
	max_st 0
	current_sp 5
	max_hp 3		// ERROR
	max_sp ezr		// ERROR
	att 3
	def			// ERROR
